## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is an investment calculator app that allows one to enter values for an investment and calculate it over a specified period of years. During this course project, I focused more on understanding Angular's standalone components and also on major Angular concepts like Components, Signals, Databinding, Services & dependency injection, Forms, Pipes, and their working principle!
